\section{Measurement setup}

To measure the performance of the code generated by our framework we use the following setup. We use 6 BeagleBone Black (BBB) \cite{BBB} as computation units. We connect them via network. 

The model is partitioned to the units in 3 different ways 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Standard -- The model is partitioned by equally distributing the model considering locality ie.\ elements that are connected have more probability of being allocated to the same unit
	\item Alternative -- The model is partitioned by equally distributing the model not considering locality
	\item Single -- All of the elements are allocated on the same computing unit
\end{itemize}
