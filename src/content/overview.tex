This chapter provides an overview of the approach to runtime monitoring of cyber-physical systems, and describes the basic architecture of the implemented monitoring framework.

\section{Runtime verification approach}

An overview of the runtime monitoring approach is depicted in \autoref{fig:approach}. 
The left hand side illustrates the connections between \emph{design-time artifacts}, while on the right-hand side of the figure, the \emph{running monitoring programs} are shown.

\subsection{Design time}

At first, the developer of the system must design the domain model of the CPS based on the structure of the target system.
From this domain model we generate the code that can be used to build up and maintain the live model of the system.

Then monitoring goals are defined as graph patterns. 
As patterns can refer to the metamodel, it is a prerequisite for pattern definition. 
From these patterns we create monitoring plans. 
We use these plans to generate the source code of the monitoring components.

\subsection{Runtime}

At runtime, we rely on the generated monitor code and the generated model code. 
We create the nodes of the live model, create the references/edges between them and give the values of the attributes of the objects. 
With the physical world changing we update the objects to reflect the current state of the system. \todo{hivatkozasok a kesobbi reszekre, ahol ezekrol tobb szo esik}
On this model, we run the monitoring code to find matches for the patterns in the model. 
If a pattern match occurs, we find the model elements that conform the pattern, thus we can locate the problems in the model, representing the cyber-physical system.


\section{Framework architecture}

Users of the framework can design the domain models of the system using EMF Ecore modeling, while they can formulate monitoring goals as graph patterns using the declarative Viatra Query Language (VQL).
Based on these definitions, the framework generates the monitoring \cpp{} program code.
The generated code also uses an additional library provided by the framework.

\subsection{Code generation workflow}
A set of Eclipse plugins provides support to transform EMF Ecore models and VQL monitor definitions into \cpp{} code. 
These plugins are written in Xtend.
\autoref{fig:workflow} shows the corresponding code generation workflow.

\end{figure}

From the EMF metamodel, we generate model code, which can be used to build up and maintain the live model. 
We also generate the corresponding DDS topics, as DDS is used to notify computing units about object creation/deletion and reference creation/deletion.

From the VQL files, we parse the graph patterns and generate the code able to execute them.
Query execution depends on serialization/deserialization service provided by protobuf, so we also create the corresponding protobuf messages and compile them into \cpp{} code.
