\chapter{Motivating example}


I show the concepts of my work using an example based on MoDeS3~\cite{} demonstrator system. Suppose that we have to ensure the correct operation of a railway system. In this system we must avoid failure because it can cause serious damage, financial loss, or even death. We can use the information from sensors perceiving the system's physical state and use that information to deduce if the system's state is incorrect and/or dangerous. 

We use model based approach to solve this problem. 

Int this thesis we focus on the tooling for this approach.
