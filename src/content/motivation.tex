\chapter{Motivating example}


I show the concepts of my work using an example based on MoDeS3~\cite{modes3} demonstrator system. It is a model of a railway cyber-physical system. In this we have to ensure the correct operation of a railway system, eg.\ Trains must not hit eachother and derailments must be avoided. In a real railway system we must avoid failure because it can cause serious damage, financial loss, or even death.

We use information from sensors perceiving the system's physical state to deduce if the system's state is incorrect and/or dangerous. We do this by creating a structural model for the system and updating it based on sensor data taking sensor data and integrate it. This is called the live model. This model graph based and we use graph pattern matching to find model parts indicating error in the physical system.
